        I was very skepitcal about Robert Pattison playing Batman because of his role in the Twilight series. I didn't think he had what it took to accurately portray a character like Batman. He proved me so wrong with his performance. The Batman has become one of my favorite movies because of it's portrayal of Batman. I always thought Batman should be portrayed as a dark character because he lives in Gotham City. That is exactly what they did in this movie. I highly recommend this movie to anyone. It's acting, cinematography, and action scenes are perfect. Take a look at the reviews on <a href ="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1877830/reviews?ref_=tt_urv" > IMDb </a>.
