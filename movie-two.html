    <p> 
        La La Land is a 2016 American romantic musical film written and directed by Damien Chazelle. 
        The film stars Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone as a struggling jazz pianist and aspiring actress, respectively, who meet and fall in love while pursuing their dreams in Los Angeles. 
        I was skeptical about this movie because it was a musical which I'm not a fan of. Thankfully, I was proven wrong because this movie exceeded all my expectations. It is a must watch. Take a look at the reviews on <a href ="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3783958/reviews?ref_=tt_urv"> IMDb</a>.
