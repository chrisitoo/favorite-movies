    <p> 
        Interstellar is a 2014 epic science fiction film co-written, directed, and produced by Christopher Nolan. It stars Matthew McConaughey, Anne Hathaway, Jessica Chastain, Bill Irwin, Ellen Burstyn, Matt Damon, and Michael Caine. 
        Set in a dystopian future where humanity is embroiled in a catastrophic blight and famine, the film follows a group of astronauts who travel through a wormhole near Saturn in search of a new home for humankind. 
        This movie has it all. It is filled with suspense, action, and tear-jerking moments. Though it's runtime is 3 hours, I highly recommend anyone looking for their next watch. If you don't believe me, then you'll believe the reviews on <a href ="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/reviews?ref_=tt_urv" target="_blank"> IMDb</a>. Christopher Nolan never fails to deliver.
